# FourTopNeuralNetwork
MSci Physics final year project trying to distinguish four top quark events from a background of two top quarks in the single lepton decay channel.

Achieved by modelling the events as graphs and then using a graph neural network to distinguish the four top signal events from a background of two tops.
